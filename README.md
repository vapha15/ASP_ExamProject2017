Synopsis

The Prize Application has 3 pages, the home-page where there is some 3d effect, the formula-page where one can fill in some personal data and a serialnumber, the submission-page where all valid sumbission is displayed, this page can display fx 5,10 or 20 submission info.

Code Example

One should check that the two serialNumberListXML.xml and personListXML.xml files are pointen at the correct directory path. But I dont think it will become a problem I have try to avoid the problem with the Path.GetFullPath method in the XMLSerialization class at line 18-19
